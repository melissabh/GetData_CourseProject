# How to generate the run_analysis.txt file using the run_analysis.R function

- The run_analysis() function is contained in the run_analysis.R file

- The run_analysis() function assumes that your current working directory
contains the **./UCI HAR Dataset** subdirectory (and all the original files
and subirectories that come in the original dataset from SmartLabs)

- Running the run_analysis() function will create the run_analysis.txt
file in your current working directory
